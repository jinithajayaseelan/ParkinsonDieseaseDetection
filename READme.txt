To understand this project we should know the following

What is Parkinson's diesease?
Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.

What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

What is train_size or test_size?
Typically, you’ll want to define the size of the test (or training) set explicitly, and sometimes you’ll even want to experiment with different values. You can do that with the parameters train_size or test_size.
Modify the code so you can choose the size of the test set and get a reproducible result
